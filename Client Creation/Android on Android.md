- Obtain the necessary .so files from the bot using the `/getapk` command.

# Actual Tutorial
1. **Download and Prepare Files:**
   - Download the GD apk and the .so files provided by the bot. Save them to an easily accessible folder on your device.

2. **Open APK Editor:**
   - Download and install APK Editor from the provided link.

3. **Select APK File:**
   - Open APK Editor and select the "Select APK file" option.

4. **Choose GD APK:**
   - Navigate to the folder where you saved the GD apk and select it.

5. **Edit APK:**
   - Choose the "Simple Edit" option.

6. **Replace .so Files:**
   - Within the APK, navigate to the 'lib' folder.
   - Replace the existing .so files in both the 'arm64-v8a' and 'armeabi-v7a' folders with the corresponding .so files provided by the bot.

7. **Save and Install:**
   - After replacing the .so files, save the changes.
   - Install the modified APK.

8. **Troubleshooting:**
   - If you encounter the "App with conflicting package already exists" error, manually change the package name to resolve the conflict.
   - If you see "App not installed", uninstall the original GD app before installing the modified version.
   - If you receive an "App not supported" error, it may indicate that the version is incompatible with newer Android versions. Unfortunately, older versions like 2.1 and below may not work on newer Android versions unless a 64-bit version of the app is developed.
   - To keep GD and GDPS separate, change the package name manually.

Enjoy your modified GD experience!

# Note
- Changing the package name manually can be tedious and is not covered in this tutorial.
