!feature - features the level

!epic - epic features the level

!unepic - removes epic feature from the level

!setacc (account name) - sets the account

!verifycoins - verifies the coins in the level, making them silver instead of bronze.

!daily - Sets the level as daily [might not work right away]

!weekly - Sets the level as weekly demon

!delete -Deletes the level from the server

!pass (new password, numbers only, must be 4-6 characters long) - Updates level password

!description (new description) - Updates level description

!public - makes the level public

!unlist - makes the level unlisted

!sharecp - Enables creator point sharing

!ldm - Enables LDM
