# FTP
First you need to download an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client.
Some recommendations:
PC: [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)
Android: [AndFTP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lysesoft.andftp)

## Now, connect to your GDPS' FTP.
Host is "noxicloud.es"
Port is 21
Username and password is given by the "GDPS Creator" bot

The login is your GDPS' name.
The password is the same as for PHPMyAdmin.

When you're connected to FTP, you can edit your GDPS' files!
