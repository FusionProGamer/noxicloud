# Creating a Gauntlet in Your GDPS Database

Follow these steps to create a gauntlet for your Geometry Dash Private Server using MySQL:

1. **Open MySQL:**
   - Access MySQL through [this link](https://ncpanel.noxicloud.es/phpmyadmin).

2. **Select GDPS Database:**
   - Choose your GDPS database from the list of databases available.

3. **Insert Gauntlet Data:**
   - Navigate to the Gauntlets table and click on the insert option.
   - Enter the Gauntlet ID and the 5 levels in order, specifying their level IDs.
   - Click on "GO" to insert the gauntlet data into the table.

**Note:**
In version 2.2 of Geometry Dash, there is a bug where gauntlets won't display unless you have at least 3-5 gauntlets created. Unfortunately, this bug cannot be fixed.

Here's a list of gauntlet names for reference:
